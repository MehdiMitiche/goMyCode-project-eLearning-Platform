    whatYouWillLEarn:
      "an introductory course, perfect for developers new to Redis. In this course, you’ll learn about the data structures in Redis, and you’ll see how to practically apply them in the real world.The course covers all of Redis’s most-used data structures, including strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. Since Redis is often used for high-throughput, low-latency applications, we’ll be sure to cover the time-complexity of the various Redis commands so that you can select the most efficient data structures to solve your domain problem.You’ll also learn about specialized Redis data structures such as geospatial indexes and bit fields. And you’ll see how to model capped collections, perform set operations, and take advantage of Redis pub/sub. Finally, you’ll get an introduction to Redis’s powerful Lua scripting capabilities.",
    whatYouWillBuild:
      "To make the material interesting and practical, the course examples model a system for hosting the Redis Games, a worldwide sporting event! You’ll use the Redis CLI to interact with the data models, and coded solutions will be provided in Python.",

According to React official documentation, following is the definition −React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native. React implements one-way reactive data flow, which reduces the boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.ReactJS is JavaScript library used for building reusable UI components.
